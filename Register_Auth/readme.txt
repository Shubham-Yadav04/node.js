this folder contains the code of athentication and registration n which i have used bcrypt to genrate a hashed password based on the users enterd password by using some salt in it  And then i use the concept of JWt to give the user an accesstoken in its cookie using the flag httpOnly to protect it from attacks 
after that if the accesstoken life will over i will use the refreshtoken present in the user file and if the lifetime or validity of that also get over then user have to login again to generate a new referesh token
